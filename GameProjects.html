							<h2>Word Wizard (Images will be uploaded shortly)</h2>
							<p>
								Word wizard is an education ESL game, focused on teaching the player conversational and writing skills 
								through gamified drills. This game is a project by Lemon Dragon studio, of which I am a co-founder. 
								I created models for the game (the highlights of which can be found in the blender projects tab), 
								oversaw most of the UI design, and developed a large amount of software for the game, including the 
								UI and code for one of the three current minigames. At the moment, Word Wizard is unreleased, and will
								be revisited in the future by Myself and other members of Lemon Dragon to finish optimizing the UI and some
								of the scenes so that it can be published on Itch.io.

								This project is an easy-to-use 3D model creator, which allows 
								users to build something using cubes, then decorate it using
								3D models, which can have their color, size, and rotation changed.

							<h2>Vertex shaders and GPU instancing in an unreleased game</h2>
							<video width=100% controls muted>
								<source src="Media/Vertex Animation Shader Demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								Your browser does not support the video tag.
							</video>
							<p>
								In order to create this demo. I began by baking two animations from blender into textures: 
								The egg creature running, and the book page turning (which was simply a physics simulation in blender). 
								From there, I created two special shaders in Unity using URP and Unity shadergraph: 
								One that animates a mesh using a texture and an extra set of uvs, and another that 
								allows one to scrub through frames of a vertex animation via scripts. The result is a way of animating
								many meshes in a scene, while still allowing the use of GPU instancing to reduce draw calls. 
								This technique also allows the use of pre-made physics-based animations in Unity without much difficulty.
								Note that many visual features of this game, such as the UI, and some special effects, have 
								been removed to help showcase this feature.

								<source src="Media/unique_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

							<p>
								This project implemented various particle effects. Techniques used include billboards, animating sprite sheets, and reusing particles.
